    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two common techniques for converting categorical data into numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns each category a unique integer value that reflects the order of the categories. For example, if you have a categorical feature called \"size\" with the categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", you could use ordinal encoding to assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding assigns each category a unique integer value, regardless of the order of the categories. For example, if you have the same categorical feature \"size\" with the same categories, you could use label encoding to assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to these categories, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between ordinal encoding and label encoding is that ordinal encoding preserves the order of the categories, while label encoding does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose ordinal encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "When the order of the categories is important. For example, if you have a categorical feature called \"rating\" with the categories \"bad\", \"good\", and \"excellent\", you would want to use ordinal encoding to preserve the order of these categories. This is because the order of these categories has meaning. For example, a rating of \"excellent\" is better than a rating of \"good\", which is better than a rating of \"bad\".\n",
    "When to choose label encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "When the order of the categories is not important. For example, if you have a categorical feature called \"color\" with the categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", you would not need to use ordinal encoding to preserve the order of these categories. This is because the order of these categories does not have any meaning. For example, a color of \"red\" is not better than a color of \"blue\", which is not better than a color of \"green\".\n",
    "In general, you should use ordinal encoding when the order of the categories is important, and you should use label encoding when the order of the categories is not important."

    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding (TGO) is a technique for encoding categorical features for machine learning. It works by first creating a mapping between each category and its mean target value. The mean target value is calculated by taking the average of all target values for instances that belong to the same category. Once the mapping is created, each category is assigned a numerical value based on its mean target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a categorical feature called \"color\" with the categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\". We also have a target variable called \"price\". The mean target value for \"red\" is 100, the mean target value for \"blue\" is 150, and the mean target value for \"green\" is 200. Using TGO, we would assign the numerical values 1, 2, and 3 to the categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "TGO can be used in a machine learning project when you have a categorical feature that is related to the target variable. For example, in the example above, the color of an object is likely to be related to its price. By using TGO, we can encode the categorical feature \"color\" in a way that is informative to the machine learning model. This can help the model to learn the relationship between the color of an object and its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the advantages of using TGO:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more informative than label encoding. Label encoding simply assigns each category a unique integer value, regardless of the order of the categories. TGO, on the other hand, assigns each category a numerical value based on its mean target value. This makes the encoded features more informative to the machine learning model.\n",
    "It is less likely to cause overfitting. Overfitting is a problem that occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well. This can lead to the model making poor predictions on new data. TGO is less likely to cause overfitting than label encoding because it uses the target variable to create the encoded features. This helps the model to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable, without overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "Here are some of the disadvantages of using TGO:\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be computationally expensive. TGO requires the calculation of the mean target value for each category. This can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "It can be sensitive to outliers. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. TGO can be sensitive to outliers, which can lead to inaccurate results."
