    "The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between the variables, while the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measures the monotonic relationship between the variables.\n",

    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI. This means that as the number of hours of exercise per week increases, BMI tends to decrease (assuming a negative relationship). However, it's important to note that Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship, and if the relationship is not strictly linear, the Pearson correlation coefficient might not accurately capture the overall association.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI. This means that as the number of hours of exercise per week increases, BMI tends to decrease or stay the same, without necessarily following a strictly linear pattern. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is more appropriate when the relationship is not strictly linear or when the variables are measured on an ordinal scale.\n",
