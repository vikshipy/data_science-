    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used in probability theory to describe the probabilities associated with different values of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability of a specific value occurring. In other words, it maps each possible value of the random variable to its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll. The PMF of X is:\n",

    "The Probability Density Function is used for continuous random variables. It gives the relative likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value within a given range. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not directly provide the probability of a specific value occurring, but rather the probability density at a particular point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

The errors can arise from various sources, such as instrument inaccuracies or natural variability, and assuming a normal distribution helps in understanding the distribution of errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Stock Market Returns: Daily or monthly stock market returns often exhibit a normal distribution, assuming that the returns are influenced by multiple independent factors. The normal distribution is useful for modeling and predicting future returns.\n",

If the mean is positive, the peak of the distribution moves to the right, and if the mean is negative, it shifts to the left.\n",

Probability Calculation: The z-score is often used in conjunction with the standard normal distribution table or statistical software to determine probabilities associated with specific values or ranges of values.

    "1. Normality Approximation: The CLT allows us to approximate the distribution of a sample mean or sum, even if the underlying population distribution is not normal.

It tells us that as the sample size increases, the sample mean or sum becomes more concentrated around the population mean or sum.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no hard and fast rule for what constitutes a \"sufficiently large\" sample size, a commonly cited guideline is that the sample size should be at least 30. However, the exact requirement may vary depending on the underlying distribution and the desired level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finite Variance: The random variables being summed or averaged should have a finite variance. Variance measures the spread or variability of a distribution. If the variance is infinite, the CLT may not hold. However, many common probability distributions have finite variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that while these assumptions are important for the strict application of the CLT, the theorem is quite robust and often holds even when the assumptions are not perfectly met. Additionally, there are variations of the CLT, such as the Lindeberg-Levy CLT and Lyapunov CLT, which relax or modify some of these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem provide guidelines for its proper application and help ensure the validity of its conclusions. Understanding these assumptions is crucial when using the CLT in statistical analysis and inference."
