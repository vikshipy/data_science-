    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the characteristics of the data being analyzed and the assumptions made about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown, or when the sample size is small (typically less than 30). It is based on the Student's t-distribution, which takes into account the variability associated with estimating the population standard deviation from a small sample. A t-test is appropriate when working with small samples or when the population standard deviation is not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario for a t-test: Suppose you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of individuals, each consisting of 20 people. Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviations are unknown, you would use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean heights between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30). It is based on the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) and assumes that the population follows a normal distribution. A z-test is appropriate when working with large samples or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "Example scenario for a z-test: Suppose you want to assess whether the mean IQ score of a population is significantly different from a known population mean IQ score. You have a sample size of 1000 individuals, and the population standard deviation is known. In this case, you would use a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the known population mean IQ score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on the characteristics of the data, specifically the sample size and the knowledge of the population standard deviation. A t-test is suitable for small samples or unknown population standard deviations, while a z-test is appropriate for large samples or known population standard deviations."

The significance level (α) and power of the test (1 - β) can be adjusted to control the likelihood of each type of error, but there is typically a trade-off between them. Researchers need to carefully consider the consequences of making these errors and choose appropriate levels of significance and power based on the specific context and goals of the study."

For example, if the sample size is large (typically n > 30) or the population follows a normal distribution, you can use the z-distribution. If the sample size is small (typically n < 30) and the population is not normally distributed, you may use the t-distribution.\n",
