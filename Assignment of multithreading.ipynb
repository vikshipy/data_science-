    "In python, Multithreading refers to the use of multiple threads of execution to perform multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. This mechanism can improve the performance of programs that need to perform I/O operations or other time-consuming tasks by allowing them to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
